Thanks for reading me. All too often I am ignored, and if I may say so, it hurts.

The ironic thing is that I do not have all that much to say, but it sure is nice
to be paid attention to. Anyway, look at me, I'm rambling.

*le sigh*

These days my cousin, the website, gets all of the attention. You can find him
at http://simdk.sourceforge.net/. Tell him I said hi, and if you do not mind terribly, 
would you let me know whether he and I are still on for bowling Thursday night? 

Grazzie.
